### Teamwork Reflection Report

#### Introduction

This project has been an invaluable experience, providing us the opportunity to collaborate effectively and harness each member's unique strengths. Hongyi, zihan and I worked together to develop a microservices-based solution for Kafka and Spark stream processing. Throughout the process, we followed the principles outlined in our teamwork guide, emphasizing open communication, shared accountability, and mutual respect.

#### My Contribution

My primary focus was on assisting with the implementation and adding value through complementary tasks, as well as coordinating meetings to ensure a smooth communication within the group. I contributed by drafting the architectural diagram, which provided a clear visual representation of the system's structure and workflows. Additionally, I supported the main contributor in refining the project components and ensuring alignment with the overall design. My efforts aimed to enhance clarity and organization, facilitating smoother collaboration and contributing to the successful completion of the project.

#### Peer Evaluations

**Hongyi**  
- **Positive Attributes**:  
  Hongyi consistently demonstrated a proactive approach to our group project, responding promptly in the group chat and actively contributing to our progress. His meticulous attention to detail in testing the load performance and documenting the results played a crucial role in ensuring the reliability of our application.

- **Areas for Improvement**:  
   Hongyi demonstrated strong attention to detail, particularly in testing and documentation, which greatly contributed to the projectâ€™s reliability. However, he could benefit from focusing more on the overall goals and main functionality of the project to ensure a balanced approach between the broader vision and finer details.

**Zihan**  
- **Positive Attributes**:  
  Zihan is the main contributor to our project group, and his exceptional analytical skills combined with his foundational knowledge of data engineering have been essential to our success.
- **Areas for Improvement**:  
   Zihan is an outstanding tech expert with exceptional problem-solving skills and an impressive breadth of knowledge, capable of figuring out solutions to any challenge. A small suggestion for improvement would be to provide a bit more direct support to the rest of the team when needed.

#### Outcome of the Feedback Session

During the feedback session, we all shared our thoughts, including compliments and suggestions for improvement, with one another. The feedback was highly constructive, and I believe everyone benefited from this experience, fostering both personal growth and career development.

Key outcomes included:  
1. Hongyi said he would focus more on the main goal/functioanlity in the future.
2. Zihan expressed his willingness to take on more responsibility in teaching and supporting others.  
3. My teammates provided positive feedback on my technical skills, and I also recognized the need to improve my data storytelling skills.

Overall, the session deepened our appreciation for one another's contributions and identified opportunities for both individual and team growth. We agreed that our collective focus on clear communication, mutual support, and respect played a key role in the success of the project.

#### Conclusion

This project was a valuable learning experience that allowed us to collaborate effectively and leverage each team member's strengths. Open communication, shared accountability, and mutual respect were key to our success in developing a microservices-based solution for Kafka and Spark stream processing. The feedback session helped us reflect on our contributions and identify areas for growth, such as Hongyi focusing on broader goals, Zihan supporting others more, and me improving data storytelling. This constructive exchange fostered both personal and professional development. Overall, our teamwork and commitment to collaboration were instrumental in achieving our project goals.
