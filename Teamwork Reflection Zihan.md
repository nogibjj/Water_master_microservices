### Teamwork Reflection Report

#### Introduction

Working on this project has been a valuable experience that allowed our team to effectively collaborate and leverage each member's strengths. Our team, consisting of myself, Hongyi, and Mu, worked together to implement a microservices-based project for Kafka and Spark stream processing. Throughout the project, we adhered to the principles outlined in our teamwork book, ensuring open communication, shared responsibility, and mutual respect. This reflection highlights our individual contributions, peer evaluations, and the outcome of our feedback session.

#### My Contribution

As the primary contributor to the project structure and code development, I focused on ensuring that our repository was well-organized and adhered to industry standards. I designed the folder hierarchy, wrote the core code for key components such as the Flask API and Spark jobs, and created Docker and Kubernetes configurations to ensure seamless deployment. Additionally, I recorded the demonstration video and presented the project to showcase our achievements. My goal was to establish a solid foundation for the team, making it easier for everyone to contribute effectively.

#### Peer Evaluations

**Hongyi**  
- **Positive Attributes**:  
  1. Hongyi demonstrated exceptional analytical skills and contributed significantly to the data engineering aspects of the project, particularly in fine-tuning Spark jobs for efficient processing.  
  2. He was highly proactive in identifying potential bottlenecks in our system and suggested practical solutions to improve performance.  
  3. His attention to detail in testing the load performance and documenting test results ensured the reliability of our application.  

- **Areas for Improvement**:  
  1. Occasionally, Hongyi focused too much on optimizing minor details.    

**Mu**  
- **Positive Attributes**:  
  1. Mu took the lead on infrastructure-related tasks, efficiently setting up the Serverless Framework and Helm charts for deploying Kafka and Spark clusters.  
  2. He was excellent at maintaining team morale and ensuring that everyone stayed aligned on project goals.  
  3. His ability to troubleshoot deployment issues quickly ensured our system remained functional during testing.  

- **Areas for Improvement**:  
  1. Mu is a good programmer. The next step for him is to become a good storyteller.  

#### Outcome of the Feedback Session

During our feedback session, each team member shared their thoughts on the project and provided constructive feedback. The discussion was incredibly positive, reflecting the strong cohesion within our team. We all agreed that our collaboration was smooth and productive.  

Key outcomes included:  
1. Hongyi acknowledged the need to balance optimization efforts with overall project.  
2. Mu appreciated the suggestions for improving storytelling skills.  
3. I received positive feedback for taking the lead on project structure and presentations, and I agreed to ensure more active involvement from all members in key decisions.  

Overall, the session reinforced our appreciation for each other's efforts and highlighted areas where we could grow individually and as a team. We concluded that our shared commitment to clear communication, mutual support, and respect was instrumental to the project's success.
